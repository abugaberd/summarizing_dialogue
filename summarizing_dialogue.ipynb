You should have one every year. #Person2#: I know. I figure as long as there is nothing wrong, why go see the doctor? #Person1#: Well, the best way to avoid serious illnesses is to find out about them early. So try to come at least once a year for your own good. #Person2#: Ok. #Person1#: Let me see here. Your eyes and ears look fine. Take a deep breath, please. Do you smoke, Mr. Smith? #Person2#: Yes. #Person1#: Smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer and heart disease, you know. You really should quit. #Person2#: I've tried hundreds of times, but I just can't seem to kick the habit. #Person1#: Well, we have classes and some medications that might help. I'll give you more information before you leave. #Person2#: Ok, thanks doctor.\n"

I figure as long as there is nothing wrong, why go see the doctor? #Person1#: Well, the best way to avoid serious illnesses is to find out about them early. So try to come at least once a year for your own good. #Person2#: Ok. #Person1#: Let me see here. Your eyes and ears look fine. Take a deep breath, please. Do you smoke, Mr. Smith? #Person2#: Yes. #Person1#: Smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer and heart disease, you know. You really should quit. #Person2#: I've tried hundreds of times, but I just can't seem to kick the habit. #Person1#: Well, we have classes and some medications that might help. I'll give you more information before you leave. #Person2#: Ok, thanks doctor. Write a summary here: \n",

    "### 5.4 - Automatically quantify model results with ROUGE metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, it's not feasible to manually check every single summary and compare it against a baseline human annotation. Beyond the fact that such an approach is not scalable (why automate the dialogue summaries in the first place if a human has to validate every output?), there's the fact that you can't easily quantify how good the summary is just by glancing at it.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to tackle this problem is with ROUGE, or \"Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation.\" This is a family of metrics that quantifies the similarity between computer-generated text vs. a human baseline.\n",
    "\n",
    "ROUGE can take the form of \"ROUGE-N\", where N is the granularity of the n-grams to compare. So for instance, ROUGE-1 compares unigrams (individual words), ROUGE-2 compares bigrams, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternately, ROUGE-L compares n grams with the length of the longest common subsequence between the generated vs. reference text\n",
    "\n",
    "The score itself can either be recall (# of matching n-grams divided by # of n-grams in the reference text), precision (# of matching n-grams divided by # of n-grams in the text to be tested), or F-score (also known as F1), which is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. Which of these to use depends on your use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "If it's more important that your output captures all the \"right answers\" (minimizing false negatives) even if you inadvertently generate irrelevant text, then use recall.\n",
    "If it's more important that nothing in your output is wrong (minimizing false positives) even if you omit possibly relevant text, then use precision.\n",
    "If you want to balance these two considerations, use F-score.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a toy example of ROUGE in action, from the rouge-score package:\n"

    "\n",
    "The first step is to set up the LoRA adapter. In the code below, I sent r(ank) to 8; this refers to the size of the low-dimensional representation that actually gets trained. Lora_alpha is a scaling factor that determines how much weight is assigned to the LoRA activations vs. to the base model. I apply LoRA to the target modules q(uery) and v(alue), which are matrices in the attention blocks of the FLAN-T5 model. We can also try to eke out better task performance by training bias vectors (which determine unit activation regardless of input). The Huggingface docs recommend \"setting bias to None first, and then lora_only, before trying all.\" The dropout parameter prevents overfitting randomly \"drops out\" (i.e., sets to zero) a fraction of the units in the model. Since FLAN is a sequence-to-sequence (encoder-decoder) model, we set task type to \"TaskType.SEQ_2_SEQ_LM.\" You can read more about the LoRA parameters here: https://huggingface.co/docs/peft/conceptual_guides/lora"

    "First, humans label prompts along a given dimension, e.g., using the HHH criteria \"helpful / not helpful\", \"honest / not honest,\" and \"harmless / not harmless\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, a reinforcement learning model is trained based on these human ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the model itself feeds its output to this reinforcement learning model and uses the generated \"reward\" to update its weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make sure that the model doesn't just \"reward-hack\" at this stage (doing whatever it needs to to maximize reward from the reinforcement learning model but neglecting its original goal of carrying out the task at hand), the learning from this rewards is tempered by a metric that calculates how similar the updated model's output is to the original model's output.\n",

The Huggingface website even has a nifty widget that lets you calculate a toxicity score for a given input sentence directly from the browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this model is quite conservative in its ratings, perhaps because their definition of hate speech is targeted very narrowly to mean language against a particular demographic group, rather than just hateful language. For instance, a sentence like \"The Barbie movie was a disgusting piece of fake-feminist materialistic garbage\" yields a 85.7% probability of 'not hate.'\n",
